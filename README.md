# 0L Discord Server Community Guidelines
##### Updated: 22 Nov 2021
## Purpose
The purpose of this discord server is to collaborate on the 0L blockchain project by creating an inclusive space for constructive conversations.
## Discussion guide 
#### Be courteous and respectful. 
The group is intended for 0L to build community and learn/collaborate on the project. Ensure all discussion is respectful toward the various members of our community. Remember that what you post may be seen by more people than in this group and is permanently connected with your profile. Think before you post! 
#### Keep posts in channels to topics relevant to the programs and applicable to the entire group. 
Refrain from discussing personal affairs in this group. Please use appropriate channels for communications on those topics. Please use direct messages to engage in personal discussions with one or more other group members. 
#### Do not harass other members in the group or in personal communication. 
No member is required to engage in personal discussions with any other member of this group. If you do send a direct message request, keep in mind that the person is not obligated to respond. If you send a message request and do not receive a response, do not harass the individual for an answer. Accept that they are within their right to refuse to engage in private discussion. Similarly, if you receive a direct message from someone you do not want to have contact with you are under no obligation to answer their message. 
If you feel harassed, threatened or discriminated against by any member of this group contact the moderators of Discord immediately. 
#### Harassment and discrimination will not be tolerated. 
Group moderators will remove without notice any member who displays discrimination or harassment on the basis of race, ancestry, place of origin, color, ethnic origin, citizenship, creed, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, age, marital status, family status, disability, receipt of public assistance or record of offences. Group modorators will act within their purview to prevent or remedy any action deemed as harassment or discrimination.
#### Photos require permissions. 
You must have consent to post any photo of your friends, colleagues, group participants or any member of the 0L community. Show the photo to anyone identifiable in the photo and communicate where you are posting and who will have access to view it. 
Do not download photos uploaded by group members unless you have permission to do so. You can seek permission by commenting on the photo. Group members reserve the right to refuse permission for other group members to download photos. 
#### Advertisements are not permitted. 
Advertisements include, but are not limited to, the following: posts about personal projects, fundraising campaigns, religious/political campaigns, pumping. This server is about technology and development, not cryptocurrency prices, trading or investing. Please do not discuss token prices on this server.
Do not interpret anything you read here from anyone as financial advice. 
Posts about technology that are relevant to the discussion may be acceptable pending moderator approval. Group moderators reserve the right to delete any promotional posts by group members. 
## Sanctions


All of the above is a guide, but they are not very useful if we don’t exercise them. So, let’s be explicit about some of the consequences. This is the only guide moderators will refer to when making a decision.

Your account can be flagged and, if a moderator agrees with the infraction, a sanction will be applied.

Discord offers the following actions:

-Ban: The member will no longer be a part of the 0L server. They won’t be visible on the server members list and will lose access to the server - meaning they can’t post messages on that server’s channels, see messages, send, or get voice chats. Further, banned members won’t be able to see other users of that server. If they try to re-enter the server via an invite link, they’ll be shown a message that the link has expired. A ban is permanent and can only be lifted by the moderators.

-Kick: The member will be immediately removed from the server. They will not be able to interact with the server’s channels or users. They will be allowed to rejoin later, should they receive an invite link. This action will often be taken as a precursor to a permanent Ban.

-Mute: The user is silenced (muted) on the server. Muting takes away the ability to send messages in all channels, though the user remains a member of the server. Muting is intended to be a temporary message that will be lifted by the moderators after a reasonable time. 
## Types of Sanctions
We will enforce 4 levels (categories) of Sanctions. The list that follows explains the 4 levels and the associated action that will be taken by the moderators:

Sanction A:
- No warning, permanent Ban. You crossed a hard line on a universal issue. No judgement about who you are as a person, but we need that activity stopped.

Sanction B:
- No warning Kick: You crossed a hard line on an 0L standard. Some time away to understand the community's ethos/priorities should be enough.

Sanction C:
- You've been warned about an issue that affects productivity. This is a repeated problem. Kick.

Sanction D:
- You're affecting productivity. You will be Muted for X time, and can read on.

Members will receive notification that the action was taken and, while moderators are encouraged to provide information on why the Sanction/Action was taken, there may be times when this is not practicable and is, therefore, in the discretion of the moderator. Similarly, warnings should not be assumed; the question of whether to first issue a warning is in the sole discretion of the moderators.

We have 2 categories of issues/offenses that will trigger sanctions: Hard Lines and Soft Lines. If behavior involves crossing both a Hard Line and Soft Line, the harsher sanction will be applied. These rules will evolve and adapt over time as the moderators continue to strive to create a positive, welcoming community.
### Hard Lines
These will be obvious for moderators to make determinations on.

- No Bullying/Abuse
Collaboration online is hard, and we might not get our way in a discussion. Being provocative is one thing, but being intentionally hurtful is not acceptable. Hard line. Your account will be flagged for Sanction A.

- No DOXing
Many people need their privacy in order to collaborate successfully. There are many people here that have day jobs, families, or public responsibilities; we make it a safe space for them. If you love Bitcoin you understand this. Hard line. Posting an identity, or otherwise attempting to uncover an identity and your account will be flagged for Sanction A.

- No Selling/Spamming/Pumping
If you are selling a product, or coins, or influence, this is not the place. Sanction B.

### Soft lines
These issues require more discretion from the moderators. The sanctions for crossing soft lines are less harsh, but repeated issues will be viewed as escalation and may trigger higher sanctions.

- Being off-topic
If community members find you often being off topic, you'll get Sanction D, and if it repeats Sanction C. If you are off-topic and also being a bully, then Sanction A.

- Unconstructive criticism
Let's focus on critiques being constructive and offering suggestions for improvement. We are all volunteers. Criticizing people's work - what they have built - is toxic and makes people not want to collaborate. If it's not obvious that it is intentionally hurtful, then Sanction D, followed by Sanction C for repeats. If it's obviously hurtful, then Sanction A.

## Note
These are the rules for discord server. Please create a PR if you feel any rules have to be amended, thank you!
